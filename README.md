## Trello web clone - Frontend
Trello is a tool that lets you organize ideas, concepts, to-dos, and anything else you like.

Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like Jira or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. That's Trello.

### Disclaimer
I coded this project while following a long tutorial on a Youtube channel, so I couldn't say it is completely mine.

However, I am confident that I understand every single line of code that I have written, because I didn't just "copy and paste" from the tutorial. 
Instead, I skimmed through it quickly and tried to redo everything by myself. 

So if you are a recruiter seeing this project, you should not be worried about my knowledge and skills. I hope I will have a chance to work at your organization.
